// @RestController is an annotation that marks a class as a request and exception handler. it can be
// replaced with @Controller (has implementation of HTTP-methods and handles requests) and
// @ResponseBody (so that you don't have to put it in each method of the class) annotations.
// @RequestMapping specifies the addresses of the controller's methods where they will be available
// on the website. can be applied to the whole class as well as to the specific method. you can pass
// additional parameters to it, such as an HTTP-method, or specify a query body type:
// e.g. consumes = "application/json" says Content-Type of the request must be "application / json".
